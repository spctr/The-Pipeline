# The Pipeline
## Setup

The proposed solution has been developed and tested with Python version 3.11.4.

The solution traverse_city_py requires a correctly formatted input. For convenience a generation script has been provided.

### Running the generation script

Run the generate_city_x.py script and provide city size N as an input argument e.g.

python generate_city_x.py 300

This will create a text file in the correct format named cityX.txt

### Running the solution script

Run the traverse_city_x.py script with the cityX.txt located in the same directory.

## Appendix
### Example input format

Example format is visible below. For completeness' sake, a text file (cityX.txt) has also been provided with the correct line break character.

1 1 9 1 1<br />
3 1 9 7 1<br />
4 1 9 1 1<br />
5 1 1 1 5<br />
